# Advanced Building Blocks - Enumerable Methods

### [Solo project]

> Enumerable module gets mixed into Arrays and Hash classes (among others) and provides lots of handy iterator methods.

### Part II:
> 1. Create a script file to house your methods and run it in IRB to test them later.
> 2. Add your new methods onto the existing Enumerable module. Ruby makes this easy for you because any class or module can be added to without trouble …
